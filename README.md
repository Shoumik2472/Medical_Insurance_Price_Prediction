# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using personal and health-related features such as age, BMI, gender, smoking status, and geographic region. The dataset contains 1338 records and is used to build a linear regression model to predict insurance charges.

The project includes a detailed analysis and implementation using a Jupyter Notebook, which is already provided in this repository. All data analysis, visualizations, and model development are done using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Project Files

- Medical_Insurance_Prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project, including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- insurance.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model, containing the following features:
  - age: Age of the individual.
  - sex: Gender of the individual (male/female).
  - bmi: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat.
  - children: Number of children covered by the insurance.
  - smoker: Smoking status (yes/no).
  - region: Residential region in the US (northeast, southeast, etc.).
  - charges: Medical insurance charges (target variable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
